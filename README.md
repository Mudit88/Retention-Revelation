Uncovering Employee Flight Risk for Salifort Motors

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees and are in need of a data analytics professional who will provide data-driven suggestions based on the data. They have the following question: whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?

This project will focus on analyzing the data collected by the HR department and on building a model that will predict whether a employee will leave or stay in the company.

The company will also benefit by identifying factors that affect their decision to leave. It is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees; thus, increasing employee retention will be advantageous to the company.

# Insights
It can be inferred that poor management causes the employees to leave the company. Leaving is correlated to working longer hours, more assigned projects, and lower satisfaction levels. This is expected because it can be disappointing to work long hours and not receive any promotion or good evaluation scores. There is a significant number of employees at this company who are most likely burnt out. It also appears that beyond six years at the company, employees tend to stay.
